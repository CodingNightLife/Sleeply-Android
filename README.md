###Fall asleep with Sleeply

Having trouble falling asleep? I did, and listening to calming music helped me.
Sleeply as of now, contains 4 sounds:

- Sounds of the forest
- Ocean sounds
- Rain
- Shamanic meditation

But I plan to add more. The user interface is beautiful and it supports playing in the background as well as a sleep timer configurable between 15 minutes and 3 hours.

Don't wait any longer and start falling asleep more peacefully!
If you know any sounds that help you fall asleep, contact me from within the app and i'll add them. Go to the [Google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/103127046711774033512) community to test Sleeply.
